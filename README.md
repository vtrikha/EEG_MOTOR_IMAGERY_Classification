Thick Data Analytics Generalization Using Ensemble Techniques: The Case Study of EEG Binary Motor Imagery


Abstract—Electroencephalogram signals (EEG) have always gained the attention of neural and machine learning engineers and researchers, especially when it comes to motor-imagery (MI) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Researchers have proposed numerous classification schemes to incorporate it with various rehabilitation applications further. However, the existing classification schemes face the performance degradation caused by motor-imagery EEG signals with low signal to noise ratio. The paper’s main objective is to classify motor imagery EEG signals that sights the novel binary classification of motor imagery movements performed with various machine learning classifiers such as Decision Trees, Extra Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVM and compares it with other ensembled classifiers such as Bagging, Adaboost and Stacking. The approach is followed by multiple pre-processing steps such as substituting outliers with mean value and exercising band-pass filter and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) on the provided dataset that aims to remove the unwanted signals and noise and supply the extracted features to the respective machine learning classifiers that strive for better classification accuracy. The proposed methodology is validated on a public dataset rendered by BCI competition II dataset III and was found to produce better classification performance metric which included performance metric parameters like accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision and recall when confronted with the existing work, thus projecting the usefulness of motor imagery BCI. The analytics is inclusive of Area Under the Curve (AUC) score and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score to display an impactful analysis.
